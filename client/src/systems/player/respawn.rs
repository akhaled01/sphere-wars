// Manual respawn system - player must press R to respawn
// The actual respawn logic is handled in the death_screen.rs module
// This file is kept for compatibility but the main respawn function
// is now handle_manual_respawn in death_screen.rs

// Note: This module is now minimal since respawn logic moved to UI system
// for better integration with the death screen overlay
